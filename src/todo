    DONE:
    #0 correcting should move the end point to the correct spot
    //fix samples bug,

    //add scrubbing in the timeline

    IN PROGRESS:
    #1 - add erasing notes with pen --- need to add removing notes from start to end time. same with penning in
    (to avoid random gaps from going too fast, also odd /back beats that dont align with current grid)

    TODO:

    playing the drums should just use the correct solution and play midi. so we dont need another file

    #2 clicking and dragging notes. doesnt erase the ones under until releasing
    #3 slider to adjust stems volume. the correct track should have the exact drum volumes that u can get
        in the editor
    #4 playback at specific points1
